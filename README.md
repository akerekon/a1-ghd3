Project Motivation and Demo
---
As a chess player, I wanted to develop a way to visualize the minor pieces (pawn, bishop, and knight) in a way that helped me get familiar with the [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library. Beyond developing shapes, I wanted to standardize scaling to display a chess board and pieces regardless of screen resolution. I also wanted to explore animations, transitions, movements, and text styling.
